# Hello-World

This is just a simple Node.js application printing 'Hello World' to console. This is my first approach to Node.js and the npm package manager.

=> Made as part of Google Code-In 2017 for [Sugar Labs](https://www.sugarlabs.org).

### Install
`npm install gci2017_npmhelloworld@1.0.1`

You will find the package in your `node_modules/` folder.
