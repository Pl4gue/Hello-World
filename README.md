# Hello-World

This is just a simple Node.js module for printing 'Hello World' to console. This is my first approach to Node.js and the npm package manager.

=> Made as part of Google Code-In 2017 for [Sugar Labs](https://www.sugarlabs.org).

### Install
`npm install gci2017_npmhelloworld@1.0.2`

### Usage
```
var moduletest=require('gci2017_npmhelloworld')
moduletest.helloworld();
```
