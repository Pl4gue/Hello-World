#Hello-World

It is just a simple Node.js application hosting two local servers with "Hello World" pages, one using plain Node HTTP and one using Express.js. This is my first approach to Node.js and the npm package manager.

=> Made as part of Google Code-In 2017 for [Sugar Labs](https://sugarlabs.org/).

Install

npm install gci2017_npmhelloworld@1.0.0

You will find the package in your node_modules/ folder.
